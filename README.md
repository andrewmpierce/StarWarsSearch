# StarWarsSearchEngine

This is a Star Wars search application using the freely available star wars API, [https://swapi.co](https://swapi.co).

I also utilized the ReduxSimpleStarter template application available from Stephen Grider at https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter. This application is based on a Youtube Search app that Stephen's [course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) walks through.


I've included the readme from Stephen's starter template below:
